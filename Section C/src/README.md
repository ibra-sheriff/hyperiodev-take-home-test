# Say Number

I have worked with the num2words package in the past and realised that I could apply to the **Say Number** problem. This would have meant that I would have solved the problem in 5 minutes, but where's the fun in that?

I love a challenge so I decided to also do the ISBN problem too and played my solution to the **Say Number** problem in the drafts directory instead.
