This is the link to my Github project for *Section B: Projects*:

https://github.com/ibra-sheriff/ea-mosaic-maker

My pride and joy since 2020 has been RINAIBRA. I thoroughly enjoyed working on the project and more importantly the lessons I learnt along the way. Unfortunately, that project sits behind a paywall so I picked this project about picture mosaic generation using an Evolutionary Algorithm(EA) instead. I had to create a mosaic maker as part of an Artificial Intelligence course, which turned out to be my favourite assignment though I found it highly intimidating initially. It was my favourite because it allowed me to run experiments on a Computational Intelligence algorithm while building a helpful program. Some of the output obtained was so beautiful that I circulated it to friends and family on WhatsApp!
